# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Folder Structure (components)
common: This folder contains generic and reusable components that are used throughout the application. Examples include basic UI elements like buttons, inputs, and other common UI components.

layout: Here, you can place components that define the overall layout of your application, such as the header, footer, sidebar, or navigation bar.

pages: This folder is for components that represent individual pages or routes of your application. Each page component can be associated with a specific route and can be composed of other common or shared components.

shared: The "shared" folder houses components that are shared across multiple pages or sections of the application, such as modals, carousels, or widgets.

... (Other folders): Depending on your project's complexity, you may create additional folders to group components based on their functionality or feature sets. For example, if you have a complex feature that requires multiple components to work together, you could create a separate folder for that feature.
